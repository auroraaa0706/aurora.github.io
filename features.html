		<td width="35%"><h2>Download Speed Acceleration</h2>
		Internet Download Manager will accelerate downloads by up to 5 times due to its smart dynamic file segmentation technology. Unlike other download managers and accelerators, Internet Download Manager segments downloaded files dynamically during download process, and it reuses available connections without additional connect and login stages to achieve the best possible acceleration performance.</td><td width="50%" align="center"><img src="1_features.jpg" width="100%" align="center"></td> </tr>

	When you click on a download link in a browser, IDM will take over the download and accelerate it. You don't need to do anything special, just browse the Internet as you usually do. IDM will catch your downloads and accelerate them. IDM supports HTTP, FTP, HTTPS and MMS protocols. </td> </tr>

<td width="35%"><h2>Dark theme</h2>
	IDM dark theme displays dark surfaces across the majority of its UI. It was designed to be a supplemental mode to a default (or light) theme. The dark theme reduces the luminance emitted by your screen, while still meeting minimum color contrast ratios. It helps to improve visual ergonomics by reducing eye strain, adjusting brightness to current lighting conditions, and facilitating screen use in dark environments while conserving power. </td>

		<td width="35%"><h2>Dynamic segmentation</h2>
	Internet Download Manager has optimized file download logic. IDM divides downloaded file on file segments dynamically, unlike other download accelerators that divide downloaded file in segments once just before download process starts. Dynamic segmentation gives significant download performance improvement. When file download starts, it's unclear how many connections may be opened. When new connection becomes available IDM finds the largest segment to download and divide it in half. Thus new connection starts downloading file from the half of the largest file segment. IDM minimizes the time needed for negotiations with servers and keeps all connections busy.

It's possible to schedule multiple grabber projects to run them once at a specified time, stop them at a specified time, or run periodically to synchronize changes. </td>
